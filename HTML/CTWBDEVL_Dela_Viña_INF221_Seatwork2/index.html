            <p>
                This journey happened after the pandemic. It was so much fun and exciting to see the outside world again, especially that we went to the beach because I love swimming. 
                This day is my cousin's birthday, we had a blast enjoying the peaceful waves and cold sea water. There's so many things to see in this place, but this is the only scene I captured
                because at this moment I felt refreshed and glad to be seeing and enjoying outside again.

                In this day, I went out with 3 of my friends. We enjoyed window shopping and strolling around SM Mall of Asia. Even though there are too many people around at this time
                we still enjoyed the day as it is not that often that we go to malls together. We ate, played in the arcade, and landed lastly on MOA's by The Bay
                This made me captured the scene as I admire the sunset. I did not just admire the sunset, I also felt refreshed and calm seeing this view after a tiring day of strolling the mall.

            <h4>Venice Grand Canal | July 9, 2023</h4>
            <p>We went to Venice Grand Canal to celebrate my sister's birthday. As we stroll around I found this astonishing view that's when I felt like I needed to take out my camera and capture the scene.
                After we finished strolling around the mall, we ate and then went inside "Wetpark Adventure Lagoon." We had so much fun as a lot of our relatives were present, especially me, since I brought
                my girlfriend with me making it more fun for me. This day ended tiring most of us but we did enjoy ourselves to the fullest inside the wetpark and that's what matters, to enjoy and make the most 
                out of our day!

            <h4>Diniwid Beach, Boracay | November 3, 2023</h4>
            <p>This trip with my family has got to be one of the most fun journey I've ever been in. We stayed at Boracay for 5 days and had lots of adventures.
                We visited different Islands, Beaches, etc. We also had our own shopping sprees (not so thrifty now are we?) well that's okay because its only one in a while
                we will ever be in this place. This place is called Diniwid Beach, there are a lot of structures that are abandoned here but is still accomodated with an amazing scenery.
                I captured this view with my cousin as the rest of our family decided to not venture and hike the path as it might be too dangerous for them. For me, this scene felt cool and calm
                which made me press my shutter as I admire the scenery's wonderful beauty.

            <p>We celebrated our Christmas on Calatagan, Batangas. At the same time, it's also my cousin's birthday. This Christmas day was too hot and tiring but still we won't ever miss
                visiting a church to pray and show our faith to Jesus. This church has its own playground where many children play, a lot of Shih-tzus were present here too, allowing our
                Shih-tzu to have her own fun with fellow dogs. I just felt capturing this scene as a memento because I don't think we'll be visiting this place again anytime soon.
